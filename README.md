## Topic
New technology is now capable of communicating and making content in ways comparable to humans. Itâ€™s called generative artificial intelligence (AI), and you can use it to excel in the workforce. Generative AI can save you time, no matter what field you work in. It can create content for marketing, forecast numbers for finance, or code for software developers. Publicists can use it write press releases. Health professionals can even use it to improve their diagnosis. **You, the worker, are still in charge, you just have more freedom to strategize, think big, and excel. Your team has been engaged by one of the largest thinktanks to help propose policy suggestions to help minimize the potential negative impact on the jobs, industry and personal data.**
